# Hack Mental Health Starter Code

This repository contains the starting code for the [Hack Mental Health coding
workshop](https://www.hackmentalhealth.care/coding-workshops).

The project is based on [this chatbot
tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-does-it-take-to-build-a-chatbot-lets-find-out-b4d009ea8cfd),
and the [accompanying code](https://github.com/van100j/tibot). While the
original tutorial focuses on a chatbot that handles time and date questions,
this starter kit includes different modules, for example, for applying
transformations to text (ex. "Reverse the word 'fish'").
